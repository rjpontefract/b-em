    /* This is going to work by having a local, pre-framed buffer which
     * contains some 1/1200s tones. When a tone is needed, we'll shift
     * a bit out of the buffer and send it to the ACIA.
     * 
     * When the buffer is empty, we get more data from the source chunk
     * and re-fill the pre-framed buffer.
     * 
     * For chunks &100 and &104, we take 7 or 8 bits out of the source
     * chunk, frame them with start, stop and parity bits, and place
     * either 10 or 11 1200th-tones into the pre-framed buffer (a.k.a.
     * "reservoir"). If 300 baud is selected with chunk &117, this
     * becomes 40 or 44 1200th-tones. Note that the 300 baud setting
     * of the ACIA has absolutely no effect on this; it is purely
     * decided by UEF chunks.
     * 
     * For chunk &102, the framing is explicit in the chunk, so we can
     * just take 8 bits out of the chunk and place them directly into
     * the reservoir (or quadruple those up to 32 bits, if at 300 baud).
     * 
     * All the above chunk types can take data from the source chunk
     * one byte at a time -- no sub-byte resolution is needed at source.
     * 
     * This is not true of chunk &114. Chunk &114 contains cycles, not
     * bits. At 1200 baud, an output 1-bit is two source bits. An
     * output 0-bit is one source bit. At 300 baud, an output 1-bit
     * is eight source bits, and a 0-bit is four source bits. For this
     * chunk type, we will take 1 to 8 bits from the source and place
     * just a single 1200th-tone into the reservoir. This will
     * necessitate a source sub-byte position, which we don't need for
     * the other chunk types. Chunk &114 uniquely does not care about
     * the current selected UEF baud rate.
     * 
     * We also have the other chunk types that contain either leader,
     * gap, or <leader + &AA + leader>. These (&110, &111, &112, &116)
     * don't have any source data. We will mostly just be supplying
     * a single bit (i.e. two 2400 Hz cycles) to the reservoir in these
     * cases. Chunk &111 (leader + dummy byte) will send a single
     * 1200th-tone to the reservoir during the pre-leader and
     * post-leader sections; the actual dummy byte will be placed as
     * 8N1 into the reservoir, so that part only will load 10 bits.
     * Since MOS always writes the dummy byte at 1200 baud, we ignore
     * the current baud setting for the dummy byte. */

     * IMPORTANT: here follows the framing for the *UEF decoder*.

     * This is *not* the same thing as the framing that is currently
     * programmed into the ACIA. We *do not* allow metadata in a UEF
     * file to go around merrily reprogramming the ACIA. That's just
     * nonsense.
     * 
     * 8N1-type framing values here are derived from the start of &104
     * chunks, and used to form the correct bitstream to send to the
     * ACIA for that chunk type only. There is also the baud300 flag,
     * which will be set by an instance of chunk &117. This one is used
     * for all data chunks.
     * 
     * Chunk &102 encodes bits, not 1/1200-second pairs of atoms. At
     * 1200 baud, these are the same thing, but at 300 baud, they are
     * not.
     * 
     * This means that even if there were widespread implementation of
     * UEF chunk &102, there is still no guaranteed way to take an
     * arbitrary stream from a tape and encode it into a UEF file
     * without first having to perform some reverse-engineering of its
     * various framings. Viper's Ultron is an example; it has four
     * blocks at 8N1/300. The agent that builds the UEF needs to be
     * aware that these blocks are at 300 baud, or it will incorrectly
     * populate the &102 chunk with quadrupled bits, i.e. "1111"
     * instead of "1", and "0000" instead of "0". The UEF file would
     * also need to contain some &117 chunks to inform the UEF decoder
     * that 300 baud needs to be selected for the decoding of that &102
     * chunk.
     * 
     * It is stupid: The tape contains "1111"; chunk &102 contains "1";
     * chunk &117 tells the UEF decoder that 300 baud is selected;
     * the UEF decoder sends "1111" to the ACIA, and we are finally
     * back where we started!
     * 
     * Only chunk &114 permits
     * a direct representation of *cycles* on the tape, not *bits*, and
     * it (very generously) uses a 24-bit number to denote the number
     * of cycles in the squawk, making it easily expansive enough to
     * contain any sensible amount of data. You can get about 800K of
     * Beeb data into a single &114 chunk:
     * 
     * 2^24 cycles / 2 cycs/bit (worst case) = 2^23 bits;
     * 2^23 bits / 10 bits/frame = 839K.
